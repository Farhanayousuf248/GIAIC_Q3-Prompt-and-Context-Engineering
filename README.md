📘 Prompt and Context Engineering Tutorial for Beginners  A Comprehensive Guide to Effective AI Communication  🎥 Panaversity YouTube Class Playlist  llm_share  🚀 Key Takeaways  ChatGPT leads the chatbot ecosystem with 46.59B visits, capturing 83% of total traffic.  DeepSeek, the second-most used model, has 2.74B visits (only ~6% of ChatGPT’s traffic).  The market includes a mix of U.S., Chinese, and European AI players.  🧠 How Large Language Models Work (LLM Fundamentals)  LLMs operate as prediction engines that:  Take your text input (the prompt)  Predict the next most likely token  Continue prediction until a full response is formed  Base predictions on patterns learned from massive datasets  Important: LLMs don’t “understand” like humans — they perform context-aware autocompletion. Your prompt influences what comes next; your context shapes what the model knows.  🎯 Prompt Engineering vs. Context Engineering Aspect	Prompt Engineering	Context Engineering Goal	Instruct the model	Provide knowledge Controls	Wording, roles, format, schema	Documents, RAG, memory Typical Issues	Vague prompts → bad output	Missing info → hallucinations Who Uses It	Designers, developers	Data & ML teams One-Line Summary  Prompt engineering = how you ask. Context engineering = what you show. You need both for powerful, reliable LLM applications.  ⚙️ Essential LLM Configuration Settings Temperature (0–1)  Controls creativity.  0–0.3: Deterministic, factual  0.4–0.7: Balanced  0.8–1.0: Creative, diverse  Top-K & Top-P  Control randomness and probability space.  Recommended presets:  Conservative: T=0.1, Top-P=0.9  Balanced: T=0.2, Top-P=0.95  Creative: T=0.9, Top-P=0.99  🧱 Fundamental Prompting Techniques 1. Zero-Shot Prompting  Ask directly (no examples). ✔️ Best for simple tasks.  2. One-Shot Prompting  Provide one example to guide behavior.  3. Few-Shot Prompting  Use 3–5 examples to establish a pattern. ✔️ Most reliable for structured outputs.  4. System Prompting  Defines overall behavior of the AI.  5. Role Prompting  Assign expertise:  “Act as a software architect…”  “Act as a UX researcher…”  6. Contextual Prompting  Give background the model should rely on.  🧠 Advanced Prompting Strategies 1. Chain of Thought (CoT)  Ask the AI to reason step-by-step.  Use phrases like:  “Let’s think through this step by step.”  ✔️ Great for math, logic, deep reasoning.  2. Self-Consistency  Generate multiple reasoning paths → pick most common answer.  Improves reliability and correctness.  3. Step-Back Prompting  First ask a general question, then the specific one.  Gives the model a foundation before answering.  4. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)  Combines:  Thought  Action (search/tool)  Observation  Next Thought  Useful for agents, research tasks, multi-step queries.  5. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)  Generate multiple reasoning branches, evaluate each, then choose the best.  Great for:  strategy  planning  creative ideation  🏆 Best Practices for Effective Prompts  Be specific & clear  Use action verbs  Provide examples  Structure your prompt  Specify output formats  Use JSON schemas when possible  Use variables for reusable prompts  Iterate and document  ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid  Ambiguous instructions  Contradictory constraints  Too many rules  Ignoring token limits  Not testing variations  🛠️ Hands-On Examples Example 1: Content Creation  Improved prompt:  Write an engaging Instagram post for a local coffee shop’s new seasonal drink.  Context: Fall season launch of Pumpkin Spice Maple Latte Audience: Coffee enthusiasts aged 25–40 Tone: Warm, inviting, not salesy  Format: - Main text (max 150 characters) - 3–5 hashtags - Call to action - Add sensory details  Example 2: Data Analysis Analyze the customer reviews below and provide:  1. Sentiment breakdown (positive/neutral/negative %) 2. Top 3 positive aspects 3. Top 3 concerns 4. Recommendations 5. Confidence level  Example 3: Code Generation Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a key.  Requirements: - Missing keys go last - Supports ascending/descending - Add type hints - Add docstring - Add example usage  🔍 Testing & Iteration Framework 1. Track all prompt versions Version	Goal	Model	Temp	Quality	Notes v1.0	Blog post	GPT-4	0.7	Good	Too formal v1.1	Blog post	GPT-4	0.7	Better	Added tone instructions 2. A/B Test Prompt Variations  Try:  different instructions  different examples  different temperatures  different output formats  3. Evaluate Results  Check for:  accuracy  relevance  completeness  tone/style  structural consistency  🔮 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) & Prompting (Optional Section)  MoE models route prompts to specialized “experts” inside the model. Better prompting → better routing → better results.  🧩 The 6-Part Prompting Framework  Role  Task  Context  Constraints  Examples  Output Format  Use this for any professional prompt.  🛠️ Prompt Coach (Reusable Template)  Use this with any LLM:  You are my Prompt Coach. I will give you a rough or unclear prompt.  Your tasks: 1. Clarify it 2. Add missing context 3. Structure it for best results 4. Suggest 2–3 alternative versions (simple, detailed, structured)  Here is my rough prompt: [INSERT HERE]  🔗 Useful Tools  https://platform.openai.com/chat/  https://aistudio.google.com/  https://console.anthropic.com/  Leaderboards: https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard
